The SQL for Data Science course covers database management and data manipulation, from foundational SQL syntax and relational database structures to techniques such as subqueries and JOIN operations.

The course wraps up with an assignment aiming to help students feel confident exploring the Yelp data provided, preparing the dataset, and presenting the insights with clear, well-commented code for evaluation.
